# salire123.github.io

This repository contains a small personal landing page for **salire123**.
It features a Google search form and a list of handy bookmarks. Search
results open in a new tab and the search box is automatically focused on
page load.

The layout is styled with a clean look using the Roboto font and a subtle
background gradient. A small SVG favicon is included and can be replaced
to personalize the page. Bookmarks can be edited directly in `index.html`.
